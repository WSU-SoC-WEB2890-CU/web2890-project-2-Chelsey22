Project Proposal

Description & Scope
	My brother-in-law is a paranormal investigator and creates, builds and sells paranormal investigation equipment. He is in need of a starting website to pull in followers and those interested in purchasing equipment and haunted objects. He has asked me to start one up for him to give him an idea of what it could look like. Right now, I would like to have 4 pages, included will be a Home page, a Products page, an About page, and a Contact page. I would like to have at least 4 sections for the Home/Landing page, with around 5-6 pictures, including the hero section and the main background image. I will have a carousel that shows images of the products that the client will be selling on the site. There will be another section, a “highlight” section with a paragraph meant to draw the user in and then a section underneath with 1 or 2 of his YouTube videos embedded. The last section will be a small “mission statement” explaining his mission and how he views being a paranormal investigator. 
The Products page will consist of his products that he would like to sell along with small descriptions. This page will have a hero section image as well as a picture for each product  being sold. I estimate there will be around 10 items for sale, and I would like to break them up into sections for haunted objects, paranormal equipment and stickers/clothing.  For the About page, I want to include at least 2 pictures and have 2-3 sections giving a background of how he began as well as a little intro to him and his team. The Contact page will have a small introduction and a contact form with at least one picture.

Significance
	I decided to take on this project because it is different from what I am used to creating and working on in general. In the past, I have usually only created more technical websites, fake businesses, website portfolios or ones that I have been given most of the content and just needing to pull it all together. With this website, he has provided photos and logos, but I have all creative rights as well as creating all the written content for it.
 I chose to go ahead and use this website for the project because this will push me in a way of trying to make sure that I don’t cross a line to where the site feels cheesy or cheaply put together. I want to be able to create an eerie and interesting website that pulls the user in while also ensuring it still feels professional. I am used to creating portfolios of myself and my work or fake business websites, but this will be a new project for me and I’m excited to see what I can create.

Equipment Needs and Resources
	For this project I am going to use quite a bit of the bootstrap framework along with sass, while customizing whatever I possibly can. For the products shop page and the contact page, I would like to be able to use the React framework and be able to connect it to a database to ensure I am able to see what was chosen in a cart as well as a person’s information that had been submitted for the future, if I have time to do that. I am going to use google fonts for this site and for multimedia, the client has provided me many of his logos he created himself, as well as images he has created or taken and links or iframes to his YouTube channel and videos.

Timeline
	While I know I have started this late, I have still been planning and coming up with the ideas that I need in order to make this website work for the past few weeks. I have worked on rough drafts of what I would like the website to ultimately look like as well. I began on July 8th and worked on it for approx. 4 hours. I worked on July 9th for about 2 hours. July 11th I have worked on it for about 6 hours.  I plan on continuing to work on this tonight for at least 2- 3 more hours and begin again tomorrow. I have a lot planned with my children and family on the 12th so I want to allot myself at least 3-4 hours. Sunday the 12th I will be able to work on it for at least 5 hours and I am hopeful that by 14th or 15th I will have it completed and ready to turn in.
